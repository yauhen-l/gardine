# Gardine - a minimalistic app switcher for Android

On Asus Zenfone (ZenUI) there was a cool gesture of swapping to the previous app by scrolling on an edge of a display.

Inspired by that idea I've developed a Gardine for my Xiaomi Redmi 4X device. 

Application requires 2 permissions:

- access to usage statistics of applications (unfortunately in Andoird >= 5.0 it is the only _easy_ way of getting recent apps)
- permission to draw overlays (a widget that is always on top)

A showcast hot it works:

<img src="showcast.gif" width="250">

After granting permissions - click `Enable Gardine` button and transperent widget will be added to the right edge of your device.

In the right upper corner you will see tiny red button to destroy widget.

Now swiping a bit from the right corner to the left will show a list with recent applications.

Do not relese a finger!

By moving the finger up or down a required app can be selected.

By releasing the finger highlighted app will be started.

Enjoy.
